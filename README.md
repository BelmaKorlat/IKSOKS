# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 
This project is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C# . The game allows two players to take turns entering "X" or "O" in a 3x3 grid. The first player to successfully place three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

This project was created for the exercise in the ProgrammingIII subject at the Faculty of Information Technologies.

## Installation and Usage
1. Download the project as a ZIP file.
2. Open the project in a C# integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the game to start playing.

## Gameplay
Upon launching the game, players can enter their names to begin.
Players take turns entering "X" or "O" in the 3x3 grid by specifying the row and column.
The game continues until one player successfully aligns three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, resulting in a win.

## Technologies Used
